                    <p>
                        The oceans covering more than 70% of the earth’s surface play an important role in the global environment, offering immense wealth of water, minerals etc on one side and large biodiversity on the other. This is the last frontier for man from where he can derive much of his needs. The living and non living resources, aquaculture, dynamics of tropic elements exploitation of physical energy along with problems of pollution and needs for conservation has caused worldwide interest in theoretical and practical study of oceans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keeping in view of the jurisdiction of the university over the coastal Uttara Kannada district, and also importance of the study of oceans, the Karnatak University felt the need for starting a post graduate course in Marine Science at Karwar, the district headquarters of Uttara.

                    <p>
                        Kannada district, about 175 km away from the main campus with following mission. <strong>To prepare competent scientific manpower for exploration, exploitation, utilization and rational management of marine resources of the sea around us.</strong>  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A beginning was made in 1968 by introducing the subject Marine Zoology as a specialization of M.Sc. degree in Zoology and a laboratory was established at Kodibag Karwar, with facilities for near shore research.     Realizing the need for further expansion of the teaching programme, the University established a post graduate centre in 1975 and offered Marine Biology as a two year post graduate course leading to M.Sc. and subsequently the M. Phil. and Ph.D. programmes. So far74 candidates awarded with Ph. D. degree and 18 M. Phil in the field of Marine Biology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There has been a steady progress in the growth of this department over the past three decades. Now there are 2 faculty members with provision for 20 M.Sc. Students. At present 14 Ph. D. Research scholars are working. There are in all 3 non-teaching staff to assist in administration and 15 daily wage workers to assist in other works. The excellent training given to the students helps them to be placed in National and International laboratories, fisheries department, private industries and self-entrepreneurships.

        <p style="font-family:Average;font-size:17px;color:#000;margin:10px">The oceans covering more than 70% of the earthâ€™s surface play an important role in the global environment, offering immense wealth of water, minerals etc on one side and large biodiversity on the other. This is the last frontier for man from where he can derive much of his needs. The living and non living resources, aquaculture, dynamics of tropic elements exploitation of physical energy along with problems of pollution and needs for conservation has caused world wide interest in theoretical and practical study of oceans. Keeping in view of the jurisdiction of the university over the coastal Uttar Kannada district, and also importance of the study of oceans, the Karnatak University felt the need for starting a post graduate course in Marine Science at Karwar, the district headquarters of Uttar Kannada district, about 175 km away from the main campus with following mission. To prepare competent scientific manpower for exploration, exploitation, utilization and rational management of marine resources of the sea around us. A beginning was made in 1968 by introducing the subject Marine Zoology as a specialization of M.Sc. degree in Zoology and a laboratory was established at Kodibag Karwar, with facilities for near shore research.</p>
